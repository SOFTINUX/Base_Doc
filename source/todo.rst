TODO
====

As mentioned before, all this is work-in-progress.

List of TODOs
-------------

The following list is automatically created by the
`Sphinx TODO plugin <http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/todo.html>`_.
If there is no list, either all TODOs are done (very unlikely), or they are
disabled with the option ``todo_include_todos = False`` in the file
:file:`conf.py`.
